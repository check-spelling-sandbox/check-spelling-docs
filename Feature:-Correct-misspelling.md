# Correct misspelling

check-spelling at present only identifies misspellings. But it would be nice if one could give it a list of corrections and have it prepare a commit / PR.

This is obviously appealing, but at present it's fairly low on my list of things to do.

As long as you have a local repository (and I usually do, although of late I've been taking advantage of the GitHub editor to skip this), it's pretty easy to fix things yourself.

At the present time, you can use [[jsoref/spelling|https://github.com/jsoref/spelling]]'s `rs` command for this or various other things.
