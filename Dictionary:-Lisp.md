# Dictionary: Lisp

At present, https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts does not include a Lisp dictionary, however there are lisp projects for which it'd be useful.

For [v0.0.22](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.22), check-spelling will include a simple dictionary for Lisp.
