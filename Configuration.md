## Quick Setup

The easiest way to get started is by copying the contents of `.github` from https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/ into your repository.

(Currently this doesn't handle PRs, but [it will soon](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/tree/prerelease/).)

## Workflow Variables

See [[Configuration: Workflows]] for the supported GitHub workflows.

| Variable | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [config](#config) | directory with config files |
| [dictionary_url](#dictionary_url) | url for primary dictionary |
| [dictionary_version](#dictionary_version) | version of primary dictionary |

See [[Configuration: Advanced]] for additional options.

### config

Default: `.github/actions/spelling`

In this directory, you can place [files](#Files) to influence the spell checker.

### dictionary_url

If you don't define a dictionary using [dictionary](#dictionary) files,
the spell checker will retrieve a dictionary. You can provide a different url
if you have a preferred base. The default includes a variable (`$DICTIONARY_VERSION`)
for a [version](#dictionary_version).

This [[feature|Feature: Versioned dictionaries]] is new with 0.0.17.

### dictionary_version

If [dictionary_url](#dictionary_url) includes (`$DICTIONARY_VERSION`),
you can override the default version.

Over time, the default version will probably change.
See [[versioned dictionaries|Feature: Versioned dictionaries]]
for more information.

## Files

Note that each of the below items can either be a file w/ a `.txt` suffix,
or a directory, where each file with a `.txt` suffix will be merged together.

| Variable | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [advice](#advice) | This allows you to supplement the comment. |
| [allow](#allow) | This allows you to supplement the dictionary. |
| [dictionary](#dictionary) | This allows you to replace the dictionary. |
| [excludes](#excludes) | This allows you to skip checking files/directories. |
| [expect](#expect) | This defines the list of words in the repository that aren't in the dictionary. |
| [only](#only) | This allows you to limit checking to certain files/directories. |
| [patterns](#patterns) | This allows you to define patterns of acceptable strings. |
| [reject](#reject) | This allows you to remove items from the default dictionary. |

### advice

This adds a supplemental portion to the comment
posted to GitHub. It's freeform. You can use
it to explain how contributors should decide
where to put new entries.

See [[Configuration Examples: advice]] for examples.

### allow

This allows you to add supplemental words to
the dictionary without replacing the core dictionary.

### dictionary

This replaces the [default dictionary](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/raw/dictionary/dict.txt).
One word per line.

If you want to include the default dictionary,
place it into the directory next to your own.

### excludes

This file contains Perl regular expressions.
Generally, one regular expression per line.
They are merged using an `OR` (`|`).

Note that these are generally case-sensitive
unless you explicitly use `(?:(?i)...)` or
`[Gg]it[Hh]ub` or similar.

Files matching these patterns will be skipped.

See [[Configuration Examples: excludes]] for examples.

Lines that start with `#` will be ignored.

### expect

This contains of expected "words" that aren't in the dictionary, one word per line.
Expected words that are not otherwise present in the corpus will be suggested for removal,
but will not trigger a failure.

Words that are present (i.e. not matched by the excludes file) in the repository
and which are not listed in the expect list will trigger a failure as part of **push** and
**pull_request** actions (depending on how you've configured this action).

You can use `#` followed by text to add a comment at the end of a line..
Note that some automatic pruning may not properly handle this.

:warning: This was previously called `whitelist` -- that name is *deprecated*.
Support for the deprecated name may be removed in a future release.
Until then, warnings will be reported in the action run log.
At a future date, comments may report this as well.

### only

This file contains Perl regular expressions.
Generally, one regular expression per line.
They are merged using an `OR` (`|`).

Files not matching these patterns will be skipped.

See [[Configuration Examples: only]] for examples.

Lines that start with `#` will be ignored.

### patterns

This file contains Perl regular expressions.
Generally, one regular expression per line.
Lines that begin with `#` will be skipped.
They are merged using an `OR` (`|`).

Note that these are generally case-sensitive
unless you explicitly use `(?:(?i)...)` or
`[Gg]it[Hh]ub` or similar.

Tokens within files that match these expressions will be skipped.

See [[Configuration Examples: patterns]] for examples.

### reject

This allows you to remove words from the dictionary
without having to replace the core dictionary.

The order of operations is:

> `(dictionary + allows) - reject`
