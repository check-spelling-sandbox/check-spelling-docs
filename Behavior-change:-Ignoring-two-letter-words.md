Afaict, two letter words just aren't worth the effort of spell checking.

I will take implementation feedback. But, `prerelease` now, and `0.0.18-alpha` (when it's released), by default, will not complain about two letter words.

See [[Autodetect valid word lengths|Feature: Autodetect valid word lengths]] for more information
