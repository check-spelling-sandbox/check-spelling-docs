Proposal:
Allow users to just pull in [streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts/tree/master/dictionaries/).

This will be much easier than doing the work of building/maintaining them.

Notes:
* For items that are single word-per-line, this will just work.
* For companies which is a multi word string per line, they could either be converted into patterns or split on whitespace -- treating each individual word as legal. (The latter is easier.)
