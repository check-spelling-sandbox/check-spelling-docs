# Notes

- This feature is experimental, and the file format may evolve based on implementation experience.
- `block delimiters` will result in the start/stop line not being checked for (forbidden)patterns or unrecognized words.
- `block delimiters` doesn't support `#` as the first character of a block delimiter -- if you encounter a case where `#` is the first character of a delimiter, please file a ticket with your example.
- The start and stop delimiters are checked for as strings not regular expressions.
- Block delimiter checks happen before pattern evaluation (and are effectively mutually exclusive to them).
- Each block delimiter must have both a start and stop delimiter and there can only be a single stop for a given start delimiter. If you encounter a case where you need to have a choice of possible stop delimiters for a specific start delimiter, please file a ticket with your example.
