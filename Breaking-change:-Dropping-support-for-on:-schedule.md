# Breaking change: Dropping support for `on: schedule`

## History

The original workaround for not having permissions for pull requests from forks was to use the [`schedule` event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule).

That was supplanted with the introduction of support for [[pull_request_target|Feature: Support pull_request_target]].

There was other contemplated work [[Limit schedule branches|Feature: Limit schedule branches]] for the feature, but `pull_request_target` has proven to be considerably cleaner than `schedule` and at this point, `schedule` is mostly abandoned.

## Plan

### [[v0.0.22|https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.22]]

Deprecates `schedule`.

It will include a warning linking to this item.

### [[v0.0.25|https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.25]]

Drops support for `schedule`.

## Migration

In most cases you should be able to refresh your workflow using https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/blob/main/.github/workflows/spelling.yml adopting a standard [`on: pull_request_target`](./Feature:-Support-pull_request_target).

## Feedback

If you're actually using `schedule`, please [check for an issue](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+schedule+event+created%3A%3E%3D2023-04-01). If there is one, please add your use case to it, if there isn't one, please open an issue and explain why you're using `schedule` instead of `push`/`pull_request`/`pull_request_target`.
