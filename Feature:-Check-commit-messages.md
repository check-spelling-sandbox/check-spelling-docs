# Check commit messages

Commit messages are often converted into changelogs which are often then committed back into repositories.

If a repository has enabled incremental checking, then it wouldn't be terribly hard to check commit messages on PRs (or non-default branches).

This would be optional, and I don't expect it to be on by default.

It's somewhat similar to [[Feature: Check filenames and paths]].
