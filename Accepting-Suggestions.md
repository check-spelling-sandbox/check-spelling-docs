1. Click the copy button (![copy icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primer/octicons/0d9000c50255bac736eb0fbbc1ffee839130a708/icons/copy-16.svg)) at the top right corner of the script from the GitHub comment.
1. Open your favorite terminal / shell.
1. Use `cd` to change to the directory containing your local clone of the GitHub repository.
1. If you haven't checked out the branch specified in the comment, use `git fetch` (possibly with the appropriate _remote_) and `git checkout` with the listed branch name.
1. Paste from your clipboard (possibly `control`-`shift`-`v`, but this may vary based on your terminal). You may need to press `enter`.
1. Optionally, review the changes.
1. `git commit` and `git push` as usual.

## GitHub's [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) client

As of [v0.0.22](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.22), the script relies on [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/).

The script will drag you through the process, but you can do it eagerly:

### Install
* üçé macOS, üç∫ brew: [`brew install gh`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gh)
* ü™ü Windows, üç´ choco: [`choco install gh`](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gh)
* ... [All](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)

### Set up

`gh auth login`

## Windows

This should just work as of [v0.0.21](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.21).

You may need to use `curl.exe` instead of `curl`.

You probably want to use `git-bash` from https://git-scm.com/download/win (install with `Enable experimental support for pseudo consoles`) which will give you `perl` (although you can use any Perl distribution).

## Manually

The code is provided as a convenience--what it does it take certain recommendations from check-spelling and apply them to the check-spelling configuration directory.

* There are probably `Unrecognized words` that need to be added to [`expect.txt`](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Configuration#expect) (or some variant).
* There may be items that are no longer found that need to be removed from [`expect.txt`](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Configuration#expect) (or some variant) so that they'd be flagged if they're reintroduced later.
* If there are [suggestions for additions to `excludes.txt`](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature:-Heuristic-exclude-suggestions), versions after [v0.0.21](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.21) would apply them, and you could manually add them to [`excludes.txt`](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Configuration#excludes) (although this isn't necessary).

## Preformatted commit (v0.0.22+)

As of [v0.0.22](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.22), in **GitHub Job Summaries** (if you're used to interacting with check-spelling via a comment, the comment will include a link to the `üìù job summary`), you should also see:

`To accept ‚úîÔ∏è these unrecognized words as correct, you could apply this commit`

You can apply the commit as a command or paste it into `git apply` / `patch -p1` or whatever tooling you're comfortable using.

Note that unlike the suggestions option, this will only update `expect.txt` (or its variants) and will not apply suggestions to `excludes.txt`, nor should it provide content from `spell-check-this`.
