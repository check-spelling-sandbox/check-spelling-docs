# Suggest corrections

While [[Correct misspelled words within GitHub|Feature: Correct misspelling]] would let people fix things, it'd also be nice to at least have the tool make those suggestions (and those might be slightly separate tasks).

My tentative idea for this is to rely on https://github.com/laurikari/tre's aspell tool and suggest the one best match if such a thing exists. I've done some [[back of the napkin|Notes on suggested replacements]] work on this.

In the interim, I've shared a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ehtjuiKF5mHUq_eVuz3lYB2Ui7XztEFBgnNjOmb9R20/edit)
that I use that works pretty well.
