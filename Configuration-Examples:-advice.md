Advice is a file that is inserted raw into GitHub comments (or potentially in the log if the commit results in stale expect items and no unexpected items).

Here are some examples:
* https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/main/.github/actions/spelling/advice.txt
* https://github.com/imazen/imageflow/blob/main/.github/actions/spell-check/advice.txt
* https://github.com/jsoref/jitsi-videobridge/blob/e26301eab0a15f2366f5d2b73e2c0cc714007a14/.github/actions/spell-check/advice.txt
