# Delta additions to the dictionary

Prior to [0.0.16-alpha](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/0.0.16-alpha) when one wanted to supplement the dictionary, one had to copy the base dictionary and then add more items.

It is nicer if one can just supply the new words without having to maintain a complete copy of the dictionary.

Released in [0.0.16-alpha](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/0.0.16-alpha) as: `allow`.

Note that this is distinct from [[expect|Feature: Expectlist]].
