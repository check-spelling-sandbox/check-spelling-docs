# Delta additions to the dictionary

Currently if one wants to supplement the dictionary, one has to copy the base dictionary and then add more items.

It would be nicer if one could just supply the new words without having to maintain a complete copy of the dictionary.

Tentatively: `allow`.

Note that this is distinct from [[expect|Feature: Expectlist]].
