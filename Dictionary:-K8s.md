# Dictionary: K8s
At present, https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts does not include a useful Kubernetes dictionary, however there are Kubernetes projects for which it'd be useful.

For [v0.0.22](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.22), check-spelling will include a simple dictionary for Kubernetes based on the contents of the dhall files in https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-kubernetes/commit/753c7d04fb70845294095abb350cdadc79a94184.
