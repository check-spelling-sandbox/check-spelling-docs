This allows you to add additional words to the dictionary without replacing the core dictionary.

See
[check-spelling/spell-check-this](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this):[`.github/actions/spelling/allow.txt`](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/blob/main/.github/actions/spelling/allow.txt) for a basic example.

Format: One word per line.

Each case/variation needs to be added individually.

If you need something fancier, you can use [[hunspell .dic & .aff files|Feature: Hunspell dictionary support]] instead.
